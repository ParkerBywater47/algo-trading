# Brief explanation of what this directory contains
* `dataset*` directories hold results for running [this](../src/backtests/optimize_dynamic_ema.cpp) code on the historical data in the `data/dataset*` directory. 
    
* `process.sh` is a script that sorts the output data by performance (the first column of the \<ticker\>\_raw.txt file)
